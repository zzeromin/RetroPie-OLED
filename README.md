## HOW DOES IT WORK
First, looking for title image from 'gametitle' folder with same filename of rom.

If no match, display title name from gamelist.xml(scraped metadata).

Could not find any info, then display the file name.

## Features
* Current Date and Time, IP address of eth0, wlan0
* CPU Temperature
* Emulator name and ROM information
* Title image of currently running romfile
* Double-byte character set support (Korean/Chinese/Japanese)


## Development Environment
* Raspberry Pi 2, 3, 4
* RetroPie v4.0.2 and later
* 128x64 OLED I2C display
